You can upload any .png(or .jpg or .jpeg) images, and they will become graffiti (a folder is automatically created in the plugins folder ("AntroGraffiti"). Drop the .png(or .jpg or .jpeg) files into it, and they will appear as stickers/graffiti in the game)

You can resize them using the arrow keys

Your mouse wheel scrolls through your uploaded graffiti, along with a visual preview of what the graffiti looks like

You can left-click to place a graffiti (30-second cooldown)

All menu actions are only available while the menu key is held down (it's a hold, not a toggle key; the menu key is "G")
